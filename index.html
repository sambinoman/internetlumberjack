                R.I.P. Our internet Lumberjack
                Forever SPARKELON

                Our internet lumberjack is our fantastic lumberjack who threatened to take down the internet of Christine Weston Chandler (CWC) our CPU Goddess. She will connect our world of fictional characters to our world. Soon we will see Bob Chandler, Sonichu, and much more.
                <br><br>
                Bob Chandler wasn't just a lumberjack, but also a loving father with his love of classic jazz and many family heirlooms. May we always remember September 6th 2011 as a day that our universe lost the one great one of the Bob Chandler ❤️ <br>
                Forever will he be missed for he made the world infinitely a better place by training our goddess of understanding the human world and the importance of worldly possessions alongside guiding CWC on the way of her powers and enlightening. <br><br>
